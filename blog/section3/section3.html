      The pandemic hit the world unannounced, bringing in its wake a plethora of challenges. While on one side, the
      pandemic led to some marvelous technology disruptions, it also cost organizations disruption to the human capital
      that fueled some of those fine innovations.​

      Working from home, which was once imagined to be a privilege, is now a transformational reality – and comes with a
      set of definite advantages in the form of flexibility of work schedule, safety, and comfort of staying indoors,
      remote collaboration, and reduced cost of living as commutes were no longer a part of people’s daily lives. As the
      pandemic revolutionized the concept of work, workplace and workforce across the planet, the ways of working were
      reshaped.​

      Today as organizations debate the sustainability of working from home and slowly open their doors to working from
      office, an undercurrent of resignations and attrition – titled popularly the “The Great Resignation” by
      economists, is looming large. So, what led to this phenomenon?​

      If businesses must survive thrive in the pandemic, people must be in a state to give their best. What makes people
      give their best? A sense of involvement with the organization, an emotional engagement with respect to their work,
      and an organizational commitment that lasts through such black swan disruptions. However, the traditional methods,
      or models of engagement may no longer hold valid in the new normal. Why?

      It is essential to be mindful that at this point of time, people’s psychological capital has probably hit an ebb.
      Psychological Capital defined as an individual’s positive psychological state of development which is
      characterized by having high levels of Hope, (Self-)Efficacy, Resilience, and Optimism. It is linked to job as
      well as life satisfaction. The need of the hour is to ask: how do we rebuild the Psychological Capital of
      people?

      Zinnov arrived at a model of employee engagement which identifies ‘Quality of Life’ as an indispensable lever of
      engagement, that is critical for preventing burnout, attrition, disengagement, loss of productivity and erosion of
      innovation in organizations. All hygiene factors such as a great work environment, work-life balance, well-being,
      pay, quality of relationships at work, policies, and benefits constitute Quality of Life. These factors are
      paramount for any employee seeking a meaningful career association with an organization, and the absence of these
      could cause disengagement. The differential in the new normal is how the pandemic has exacerbated the need for
      Quality of Life for all people. If there was ever a time that Quality of Life mattered the most to everyone, its
      most certainly now.​

      Here are the five sub levers of Quality of Life at work, and how they affect employees.
