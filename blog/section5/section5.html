      <p class="blog-section5-text">
        In an ordinary work from office set up, what can help make up for a great work environment? The office
        infrastructure? The cozy beanbags? Or snooker tables? Or great food at the cafeteria? While one cannot arguably
        deny the role of an awesome office infrastructure in keeping employees comfortable at workplace, the rules of
        new workplace have transformed as homes have begun to double as offices. The enablers of comfort in this new
        office are flexibility, connectivity, and ergonomics. Flexibility pertains to how work schedules have been
        integrated with personal lives of employees, letting them strike a balance between their personal and
        professional commitments. Connectivity in work from home is all about access to our “virtual colleagues” through
        the digital. An ergonomically conducive workstation goes a long way in preventing physical ailments that may
        arise due to prolonged hours spent on the laptops. The organizations that enable these three facets are the ones
        where employees are likely to stay for longer.

      <p class="blog-section5-text">
        Iceland recently introduced shorter work week of 4 days, and the concept has been picking up momentum across the
        globe as a strategy to boost employee happiness. In India, some best practices that emerged were restricting
        emails beyond business hours, no meeting Fridays, and limiting the meeting timings. But the secret sauce to
        create a culture of a healthy work-life balance is to have the leaders role model the behaviours that set the
        right tone.

      <p class="blog-section5-text">
        If there ever was a time that employees were most vulnerable, it’s now. The risk of the virus looms large even
        as corporations have announced the opening of their offices. Evidently, in a compromised situation of public
        health, expecting employees to return to work is one of the biggest reasons behind The Great Resignation.
        Employees have adjusted to the new normal of working from home –with greater time to spend with their family.
        The reverse migration of labor has meant that employees returned to their hometown, comfortably nestled in their
        homes, without the hassle of commute and traffic congestions of metropolitan cities, and started co-habiting
        spaces with their parents, children, or in-laws. The interconnectedness of family is not something employees are
        willing to give up now. As a result of which, there’s a mindset shift for employees, which companies must be
        willing to accept and adopt the flex model of working.

      <p class="blog-section5-title">Pay</p>
      <p class="blog-section5-text">
        Compensation as a driver of performance has always been critical, but it is more so now and in future as the
        risk and prevalence of infectious diseases rise, propelling employees to look for greater financial and social
        security. The pandemic was an eye-opener on how fragile human life is, and the second-best antidote to that,
        after well-being, was to have a financial safety net for employees and their loved one. Organizations took hard
        measures in form of pay cuts in the beginning of the pandemic, however most gradually restored the pay
        reductions as businesses recovered from the initial economic setback. Innovative practices such as hardship
        allowances for frontline staff gained popularity as a reward mechanism for jobs such as health care staff,
        housekeeping, security, retail sales, food delivery staff etc., that were most susceptible to the risk of virus
        exposure. Companies introduced disaster management corpus to be able to assist employees who faced hardship of
        escalating healthcare costs for impacted family members.

      <p class="blog-section5-text">
        The new normal had meant that people multi-task child/elderly care while delivering project milestones on a
        given workday. For leaders, this means more of an empathetic style of managing teams – open communication with
        breakdown of conventional hierarchical structures. In situations of work stress coupled with environmental
        stress caused by the looming humanitarian crisis, having colleagues who are supportive towards diverse life
        needs can increase emotional engagement with the organization. The reverse is also true – a lack of empathetic
        work environment could lead to disgruntled employees, who might be on the bleeding edge of resignation when
        economy is favorable.
