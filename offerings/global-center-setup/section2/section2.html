      <p>Now more than ever, there is an increasing need for companies to quickly and efficiently optimize their
        resources to help sustain them from future shocks. Large companies have found immense value in creating
        Global Centers of Excellence (GCoE), which extend beyond the traditional GCC/GIC models, to establish
        expertise, drive innovation, access global talent and markets. We act as an extended team to our clients
        from strategy, to execution across this value chain. Our seasoned advisory teams bring deep and nuanced
        domain expertise ensuring there is a sustainable engine of business and operational excellence.</p>


      <p>While larger organizations leverage value from setting up Global Centers of Excellence, the process involves
        high upfront investment and usually takes between 6 to 8 months to setup. We are witnessing an increasing
        number of small and mid-size companies looking for quicker and less cost-intensive solutions to ramp-up
        their operations. The evolving business scenario has propelled companies to pivot to models that ensure
        resilience, continuity, and efficiency.</p>

        Zinnov’s GCoE Accelerator Model is a “plug- and- play” solution which can be turned-around in as little as 90
        days and helps companies rapidly scale new capabilities and ways of working. GCoE Accelerators provide clients
        with the same benefits are a traditional center but with lower risk, no long-term commitment, lower upfront
        investment, and ultimately, significantly more flexibility in terms of scale and exit options.
